                    <br/><br/>The cipher algorithm consists of replacing the original characters with new characters in a shifted alphabet (relative to the classical alphabet).
                    <br/><br/>This encryption is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his personal correspondence. It is no longer used in a real-world environment on its own, as it provides weak security - it is easily breakable.
                    <br/><br/>The ease of cracking is due to the limited number of keys (number of shifts). There are 26 possible keys for decryption. Using bruteforce, the ciphertext is very easy to decrypt.',
