    "annotation" => "Blowfish is a symmetric block cipher used in a large number of encryption products. Its variable key length of 32-448 bits makes this algorithm very secure.
                    <br/>It is an algorithm created in response to the slower and older DES (Data Encryption Standard). It uses 64 bit blocks and 16 \"rounds\" of Feistel function in its encryption.
                    <br/>The only drawback is the variable encryption key - each change slows down the process. There are 521 changes/computations of subkeys in the entire encryption cycle, which works out to about 4KB of data.",
